## Notes
For this assignment, I was able to successfully implement and test the **POST** and **GET** endpoints for the Recipe Finder backend. Both creating new recipes and retrieving the list of recipes are working correctly (see Postman screenshots in the submission).

Due to time constraints and technical issues, I was not able to fully complete the **PUT**, **GET by ID**, and **DELETE** endpoints. The routes are defined in the backend code, but additional debugging is needed to get them working correctly.

If I had more time, I would continue troubleshooting these endpoints and then proceed with building the React frontend to consume the API. For now, the backend partially fulfills the requirements and demonstrates the main functionality.
